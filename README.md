## Yet another web developer

Hi there! I'm Owen, another front-end developer.
Outside of coding, I spend a lot of time playing video games. My collection spans almost all genres, from famous triple-A titles to indie gems. I have even contributed to Chinese localization efforts for a indie game!

You can contact me via [owentsai.v@gmail.com](mailto:owentsai.v@gmail.com).
