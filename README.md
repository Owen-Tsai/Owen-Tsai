## Yet another web developer

Hi there! I'm Owen, a web developer with focusing on front end techniques & UI design.

I'm currently employed. But I'm always seeking challenges.
You can contact me via [owentsai.v@gmail.com](mailto://owentsai.v@gmail.com).

And here is [my website](https://mmcai.top/) (posts written in simplified Chinese).

## Fun facts about me

- :video_game: I play video games a lot, from the most famous titles to the indie ones. I even tried to design and develop several prototypes.
- :cat2: I love cats.
- :grinning: I speak English and Chinese. I provide Chinese localization for some indie games and technical documents.

## Recent Status

- :books: I'm not reading at the moment. Any recommendation?
- :video_game: Playing *Cyberpunk 2077*, *Ace Attorney 3* and *Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord*.
