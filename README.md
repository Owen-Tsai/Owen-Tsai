## Yet another web developer

Hi there! I'm Owen, a web developer focus on front end techniques & UI design.

I'm currently employed. But I'm always seeking challenges.
You can contact me via [owentsai.v@gmail.com](mailto://owentsai.v@gmail.com).

And here is [my website](https://pdpcy.club/) (posts written in simplified Chinese).

## Fun facts about me

- :video_game: I play video games a lot, from the most famous titles to the indie ones. I even tried to design and develop several prototypes.
